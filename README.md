CNNs are special neural networks that are especially useful for image recognition and classification

## In this section, I have shown examples of 3 CNNs
- A Pytorch based program to analyze the MNIST digit data
- A program to analyze Fashion MNIST data with a pre-trained RESNET34 model
- A program to analyze Fashion MNIST data with a pre-trained RESNEXT50 model
